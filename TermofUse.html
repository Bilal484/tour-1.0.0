                            renewal period(s), your Subscription automatically renews for successive periods of the same
                            duration as the initial Subscription Period, at the then-current applicable Subscription Fee
                            notified by IncNet. However, either party may notify the other party at least 14 days before
                            the end of the then-current Subscription Period of its election to cancel the Subscription,
                            in which case the Subscription will not automatically renew.

                            within 14 days of a notice requiring such action. If IncNet exercises this right, you will
                            not be entitled to a refund of pre-paid Subscription Fees. If you validly exercise this
                            right, you will receive, on request, a pro-rata refund of pre-paid Subscription Fees based
                            on the unexpired portion of your pre-paid Subscription Period.
